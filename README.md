# EquiHive 🐝

**EquiHive** is a full-stack stock trading platform and a functional clone of **Zerodha**, India's largest stockbroker. This project replicates core trading features, including a real-time dashboard for holdings and positions, order placement, and a secure authentication system.

The project is built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and features a micro-frontend architecture separating the Landing Page from the Main Dashboard.
